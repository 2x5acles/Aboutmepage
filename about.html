      <p>Hey I'm Annisa a Ux Designer who's all about creating intuitive, engaging, and accessible experiences. With over seven years in customer service, I've seen firsthand what where users struggle; and that's what drives me 
        to design solutions that just make sense. I earned my Google UX Design Certification and have experience in conversational design, making digital interactions feel effortless. Right now, I'm leveling up my skills in web devoplment through The Knowledge House. Great design doesn't stop at visuals. I am all about how everything works together. 
        Outside of UX, I'm a all around creative. Whether I am making clay figurines or spinning tracks as a DJ, I love bringing ideas to life in fresh, exciting ways. My goal? To craft digital experiences that flow as smoothly and perfectly as a mixed set.
